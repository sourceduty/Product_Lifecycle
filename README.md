[Product Lifecycle](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-OProkUusP-product-lifecycle) was developed to assist users in analyzing and tracking the lifecycle of historic products. It helps determine the peak popularity of a product and its subsequent decline into unpopularity. By leveraging market trends, historical data, and cultural impact, this GPT provides insights into when a product reached its zenith and when it fell out of favor. This information is crucial for understanding market dynamics and consumer behavior over time.

To achieve this, Product Lifecycle engages users through a step-by-step multiple choice process. This structured approach ensures that users can systematically input relevant data and preferences, facilitating a thorough and accurate analysis. The GPT asks targeted questions to gather specific information, such as the time period of interest, key events that might have influenced the product's popularity, and any relevant market data. This methodical process helps in constructing a detailed and precise lifecycle model for each product.

In addition to data collection and analysis, Product Lifecycle visualizes the lifecycle of products using Python. It generates clear and informative charts that depict the rise, peak, and decline of a product's popularity. These visualizations make it easier for users to grasp complex trends and patterns, aiding in more informed decision-making and strategic planning. Whether for academic research, business strategy, or personal curiosity, Product Lifecycle offers a comprehensive tool for exploring the historical trajectories of various products.
